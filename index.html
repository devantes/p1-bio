	<h3>My life on a Website</h3>

		<p>Venturing into my domain gives you access to know about me. 
		Born and raised in Spokane, WA. I was the only child from my parents, James Crockett and Shaketa Smith. Giving birth to 9.9 oz. of creative genius in 1992. I have grown to appreciate the time spent with those around me, having been bounced around school to school every year until I was 13 allowed me to experience a little bit of everything that makes life worth living.

		<p>It was not until I moved in with my dad after being bounced between my mom and grandma that I actually was able to stay in one school for more than a year. Leading to spending the majority of my time growing up on the north side of Spokane. Later on I found myself attending John. R. Rogers high School (the same high school my father and mother met at), which media and society categorized as a ghetto school, due to low graduation rates and judgmental peers. Yet, it was here at this out casted school that I found my muse, my passion. Senior year at Rogers was the year I was introduced to the art of graphic design. In my case due to my poor drawing genetics, digital art allowed me to express certain parts about myself that were laid dormant after an life changing event that happened to me earlier in my life.</p> 

		<p>I had the option after high school to take my studies in a direction that would of made me become a physical therapist. But that was a route I was on only to move myself into a new tax bracket. A move that would have been beneficial finically, but I chose to love what I do, and now love the benefits. Now on track at Eastern Washington University to obtain a major in Visual Communication and Deign and a Minor in Film. I have made the choice to live a content life knowing that I can get up everyday doing the ne thing I love, and go to sleep every night as the designer I dreamed of being. </p>

	<h3>My Passion of Design</h3>

		<p>Defining my passion can be troublesome, especially when I draw my passion from the world around me. Every experience takes me further, every achievement takes me further, every failure takes me even further. It is in those moments of a successful design sparking the smile of a client, and those moments of attempt after attempt to get a design right that drive me to the brink of insanity. It is in those moments I find my passion.</p>
